Another excellent suggestion from Gordon Joly, this year's "Dorkbike" is a (fairly) easy cycle trip
from Harold Wood station (26 min by train from Stratford) to <a href="http://www.secretnuclearbunker.com/secret-nuclear-bunker-admissions.php/">the Kelvedon Hatch nuclear bunker in Essex</a>: from noon-4/5pm, less than 20 miles total cycling distance - plus
some pedestrian options (details below), and a <a href="">Facebook event</a> if you want to see who's
coming...

Not got a bike? You could potentially meet us by foot or car around 1.30pm at the nuclear bunker.

NB: You are responsible for your own safety and personal possessions at all
times - always be aware of potential hazards and other cyclists and pedestrians. 
Don't forget to bring a proper bike lock and spare inner tube if you can get one
- plus food and drink unless you want to rely on cafes at the various stopping
points. There are toilets at Stratford station and at the nuclear bunker as well.
